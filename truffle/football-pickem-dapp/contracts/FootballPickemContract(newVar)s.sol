/*
things i could add 
- could have a decryptor on the front end that shows you what your picks are that goes back and forth
- it would not be TOTALLY private unless we do hash them with the public key. but we could also have the user enter the public key so that he could still decyrpt on his own
- the above seems like an extra thing to add, get the MVP first


things i am not sure about
- maybe i might end up having them actually uploading a string of numbers, seperated by sapces. "1 15 24 7 4 3 5" etc. no hiding. that could also be my MVP
- how the oracalized proof works
- how the maintenance stuff works
- how will i upload the games? all at once already? 16 different games you can enter? this has to do with the risk stsruct
- wtf is mutex and how do i use it
- so an _ in front of a varialbe is distiigushing local function variables from global variables
- how does reentry guard work and what does it do? i know i can find this on the internet

	/*what would be the easiest way to transmit user information? 
	need to have a dropdown menu, with options 1-16 so the user cants screw it up
	01-16 actually so i can split it up at intervals of 2
	then i could sha3 it with the users account name and the sting of 
	010405130406 etc etc. so overall the front end will take all of those numbers*/

i need to think, how often do I need to make oracle calls???????
i need to think when do I need things on the blockchain? and when do i need them off the blockchain
	1. definetly need to get oracle to call for the game results
	2. I do not want to hardcode in oracle games , as the last few weeks can change 
		quickly or be TBD. so tuesdays or wednesdays, oracle should call for the 
		games. but, then i want user to be able to enter games whenever. 
			.....yeah this is front end stuff. i can change to accomodate. only release the entry based on day i decide. so the games themselves should be hardcoded. but front end should let me change how people can enter and when
		and it only depedns on thursday start and monday end. so maybe its okay
	3. i believe i want the oracle to upload the user bet to IPFS. i do not want 
		to store that data on a server. this dApp is backend-less ... i think
	4.oracle then needs to call off all the of the values from IPFS and give 
		back to smartContract to add up scores and see who won. 
		highest score gets paid out

	so in summary. pull game results. post on ipfs. pull from ipfs
	the other has pull risk, post on ipfs. pull flight result, pull ifps. i have one less step in risk 
	

	how does winning logic look. oracle needs to grab the 16 games and have Home and away. it will
		parse the string, and maybe go HOMETEAMTAG05H. so denver home vs seattle, pick denver to
		 win is DEN05H. seattle is DEN05S. YES!... but needs updating based on what API i use
		 it also needs to show all users entries at the end, so that people know they legitimately won. front end thou



/*how do I want to set up betting on the WEEKS and YEARS	
	I should just forsure not hardcode it.
	each week is a policy you can enter on in each year
	the smart contract gets the next week one week ahead. it makes a new "policy"
	the entries can then enter on that week
	which means i will have to close down and open up an old one and a new one on the same function
	which means now i will have 4 steps.

		(initiation) pull so we have two weeks
		post users entries on ifps
		pull game results. 
		oull from ipfs and confirm winner and payour
		pull new week, open it to entry
		repeat

		each new week will have 10-16 games, so strings will be different

in flight one, there is a pool of possibile policiea (very large)
	a customer can make 3 or 4 or 1 polciies. that individual one gets approved
	each policyID holds the customer, and the choices  they made
	determine if you win or lose from outside results. many diff policies can win


in football app, there is a pool of possible weeks to play (smaller)
	a customer can make 1 or 2 or 3 entries in one week, or multi weeks
	each entryID should hold the customer address, and the choices they made.
	which would be the week as well as the string chosen


week 01 //chosenWeek
	entry 01 //choosen String
		address 0x
		string DEN05H
	entry 02
	entry 03
week 02
	entry 01
	entry 02
	entry 03

only one week at a time can be bet on. 
this way i can have every entry be calculated in correct order and not mixed
weeks will take on same view as risk. cuz its an outside variable changing payout
and it doesnt make WEEK super important. week just is one thing that can be won. the
results are seperate from the entry. entry is how you get paid out. it checks if your
entry won based on results from risk. one person gets paid. end.

i need to figure out how much of this I can do OFF the blockchain, off of solidity
but can solidity do calculations, without costing the EVM
