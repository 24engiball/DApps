//would be nice to have a UI that will actually show on www.blockchainpatreon.com the countdown till they can withdraw money :)


/*

CREATOR
-so the contract allows for acceptance of money to the contract specifically
    constructor 
-give the creator control, he and only he can withdraw when he wants
    one function
-creator customizes the project so he can decide (for now, maybe hardcoded 1$ donatations, that reoccur monthly. and then a one time payment
    two functions)

PATREON
-have a reoccuring payment
-have a single payment 
-be able to see what the artist does




DAPP DEVELOPER
-doesnt get any fees
-will still have to be some fees to operate the contract? maybe or maybe not. if so need a fund. look at my other contract to see if it was just orazclize and betting funds
- indexed
    what type of artist they are
    their website orrrr title of there account
    the contract address (i think auto indexed)
- but dapp dev is able to set up the firsts contract ever, which is there so people can donate to it so he can develope the acutal platform 
- elaborate how this is a better model than getting paid 1% of everything. cuz its open source stuff



does not have 10% fees!

Story script for first explaination of a dApp

Patreon Factory
- this is your common factory for making something over and over again which is a common coding practice. lets break it down
- create contract takes a name, which is the name of your contract
- it ends up returning the new contract address, the name of it (bytes32 because thats the only way contracts can interact), the uint of the contract, and the address of the person who called it
- what the fucntion does. 
    it created a contract, increases the length of newContracts 
    it saves the address that created this contract with a push into a dynamic array
    then it creates a new contract, passing the two values it needs to that contract function
    two more pushes to save newContract and name
    then we LOG both address (this may be gone)

- thats about it. it also has three getter functions for convience sakes (i only know of one that is used right now)d


Single Patreon Contract
- The ledger
    the ledger is needed in order to record values that people have donated, who has donated, and what has
    been done with the donations over time. These numbers are stricly ledger numbers, and dont represent real ether
    but they have to be used to be able to transfer ether, and update the ledgers. if the ledger gets fucked up
    ether wont get sent around properly 
    - need to explain why its [13]

- struct donationData
    this holds donators address, donations remaining and starting

- [] donators
    a dynamic array of the struct above

- mapping patreonIDs
    mapping realting eth address to the patreon ID

-function SinglePAtreon (constructor)
    just gives the contract a name, a number, and creators address (through use of getter function from factory)

-function SetOneTimecontribution)
    a funciton only the creator can call, which allows them to determine how much a one time donor can give to them. 1$, 10$, .1 ether. customizable
    
-function oneTimeContribution() 
    just straight up trasfers the money to creaotr address. 
    logs it to show it happens
    increases the number of single contributions 

-function setMonthlyContribution ()

-function monthlyContribution ()
    elaborate way to prevent duplicate monthly contributions
    make a patreonID
    set the patreonIDs mapping to match address to patreon ID
    save donationData struct in memory and name if pd
        this part is weird and round about but figure out why it is all done at once instead of 5 seperate
    just update ledger

-function patreonCancleMonthly()
    make sure correct patreonID is grabbed form address
    block the thing from 0 address
    revert if already 0
    figure out moths removed
    update full ledger
    then send refund (always do after)

-function checkIfPAtreonsAreDoneDonating ()
    inetnal function to know when to stop taking a donation for the next month
    called from creatorWithdrawMonthly

-function creatorWithdrawMonthly
    uses time to figure out when the first of each month will be
    needs to dunamically change it with a lot of logic
    this could be a seperate contract
    figures out amount to withdraw (right now a constant eth amount and a variable donator amount)
    update ledger
    check if anyones done
    update ledger
    transfer

    then a big if funciton to figure out which month it is, so it knows the unix time for the next release
