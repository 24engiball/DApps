    it would have to be deployed though on real net or testnet
    so this is blanked out now, but would be filled in and also one Single Patreon contract would be directly linked to one factory.
    you could always deploy another factory but it wouldn't interact with the other
    this is what is required, because the FRONT END calls upon patreon factory to give a list of names it can donate too
    however IF someone wanted to keep callinig single patreon on their own, it wouldnt effect the patreon factory, which is the main contract
    so it is important that partreon factory can't be messed with or manipulated with entries

    NOTE: it should actually throw at creator = pf.getOringalCreator(contractNumber) - unless called from a patreon contract! (unless someone took made a replica contract whcih returns diff value....)

Story script for first explaination of a dApp

Patreon Factory
- this is your common factory for making something over and over again which is a common coding practice. lets break it down
- create contract takes a name, which is the name of your contract
- it ends up returning the new contract address, the name of it (bytes32 because thats the only way contracts can interact), the uint of the contract, and the address of the person who called it
- what the fucntion does. 
    it created a contract, increases the length of newContracts 
    it saves the address that created this contract with a push into a dynamic array
    then it creates a new contract, passing the two values it needs to that contract function
    two more pushes to save newContract and name
    then we LOG both address (this may be gone)
- thats about it. it also has three getter functions for convience sakes (i only know of one that is used right now)d

Single Patreon Contract
- The ledger
    the ledger is needed in order to record values that people have donated, who has donated, and what has
    been done with the donations over time. These numbers are stricly ledger numbers, and dont represent real ether
    but they have to be used to be able to transfer ether, and update the ledgers. if the ledger gets fucked up
    ether wont get sent around properly 
    - need to explain why its [13]

- struct donationData
    this holds donators address, donations remaining and starting

- [] donators
    a dynamic array of the struct above

- mapping patreonIDs
    mapping realting eth address to the patreon ID

-function SinglePAtreon (constructor)
    just gives the contract a name, a number, and creators address (through use of getter function from factory)

-function SetOneTimecontribution)
    a funciton only the creator can call, which allows them to determine how much a one time donor can give to them. 1$, 10$, .1 ether. customizable
    
-function oneTimeContribution() 
    just straight up trasfers the money to creaotr address. 
    logs it to show it happens
    increases the number of single contributions 

-function setMonthlyContribution ()

-function monthlyContribution ()
    elaborate way to prevent duplicate monthly contributions
    make a patreonID
    set the patreonIDs mapping to match address to patreon ID
    save donationData struct in memory and name if pd
        this part is weird and round about but figure out why it is all done at once instead of 5 seperate
    just update ledger

-function patreonCancleMonthly()
    make sure correct patreonID is grabbed form address
    block the thing from 0 address
    revert if already 0
    figure out moths removed
    update full ledger
    then send refund (always do after)

-function checkIfPAtreonsAreDoneDonating ()
    inetnal function to know when to stop taking a donation for the next month
    called from creatorWithdrawMonthly

-function creatorWithdrawMonthly
    uses time to figure out when the first of each month will be
    needs to dunamically change it with a lot of logic
    this could be a seperate contract
    figures out amount to withdraw (right now a constant eth amount and a variable donator amount)
    update ledger
    check if anyones done
    update ledger
    transfer

    then a big if funciton to figure out which month it is, so it knows the unix time for the next release
